# Welcome to my collection of Obsidian Snippets

Here you will find my simple collection of snippets for Obsidian. 

The content is heavily inspired but the many people who contribute to the Obsidian Discord and Forums. 

Please note: none of this is my work. Especially the snippets for the AnuPpuccin theme - the code is a direct copy/cut/paste from the AnuPpuccin Theme. I take zero credit for this. 

Please also note that you use these snippets AT YOUR OWN RISK. I provide ZERO support. 

Please feel free to use my work but attribute the fine people on the Obisidan Discord and Forums that have created it.

NOTE: currently the snippets work with DARK MODE. I do not use LIGHT MODE and do not intend to adjust the snippets accordingly.
